However, the high computational cost of DETRs limits their practical application and prevents them from fully exploiting the advantage of no post-processing, such as non-maximum suppression (NMS). In this paper, we first analyze the negative impact of NMS on the accuracy and speed of existing real-time object detectors, and establish an end-to-end speed benchmark. To solve the above problems, we propose a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer (RT-DETR), the first real-time end-to-end object detector to our best knowledge. Specifically, we design an efficient hybrid encoder to efficiently process multi-scale features by decoupling the intra-scale interaction and cross-scale fusion, and propose IoU-aware query selection to further improve performance by providing higher quality initial object queries to the decoder. In addition, our proposed detector supports flexible adjustment of the inference speed by using different decoder layers without the need for retraining, which facilitates the practical application in various real-time scenarios. Our RT-DETR-L achieves 53.0% AP on COCO val2017 and 114 FPS on T4 GPU, while RT-DETR-X achieves 54.8% AP and 74 FPS, outperforming the stateof-the-art YOLO detectors of the same scale in both speed and accuracy. Furthermore, our RT-DETR-R50 achieves 53.1% AP and 108 FPS, outperforming DINO-DeformableDETR-R50 by 2.2% AP in accuracy and by about 21 times in FPS.","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://blog.moorlands.cn/notes/ai/DETRs-Beat-YOLOs-on-Real-time-Object-Detection.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:site_name","content":"荒地"}],["meta",{"property":"og:title","content":"DETRs Beat YOLOs on Real-time Object Detection"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2304.08069 Abstract Recently, end-to-end transformer-based detectors (DETRs) have achieved remarkable performance.
